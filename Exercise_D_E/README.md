**Progress:**

I have learnt to adjust the container size in different media query. It is worth a try to build the mobile website first and later for the other devices so that the mobile devices can load the website faster. It can be done by putting small screen design as the main design and the larger screen design in the media query. I believe it is also beneficial to the website development starting the smallest design and then expands it.
